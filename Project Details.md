# Project Overview
The Mutual Aid Crowdfunding Database is a platform designed to facilitate peer-to-peer assistance for individuals and communities affected by crises, such as wildfires, natural disasters, or financial hardship. Inspired by platforms like Craigslist and GoFundMe, our project aims to provide a streamlined, transparent, and user-friendly system where people in need can request aid and donors can easily contribute.

This database will allow users to create listings for financial assistance and enable donors to browse and choose whom to support, ensuring direct impact and efficient allocation of resources.

## Key Objectives
✅ Provide a centralized platform for individuals seeking and offering aid.

✅ Ensure transparency and accountability in crowdfunding efforts.

✅ Facilitate direct connections between donors and recipients.

✅ Offer an intuitive user experience, modeled after platforms like Craigslist and GoFundMe.
